cut -d: -f1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ':[0-9]{4}$' | cut -d: -f1

# cuts the first (username) and third (UID) colon-delimited fields from /etc/passwd
# then filters for the resulting lines which end with a colon and four digits
# then cuts the first (username) field from that
# result: a list of users with UIDs between 1000 and 9999
# (Human users have UIDs starting at 1000)

# If you have more than nine thousand users on your system, this will fail
# It's necessary to restrict the result to 4-digit UIDs in order not to catch nobody (UID 65534)
